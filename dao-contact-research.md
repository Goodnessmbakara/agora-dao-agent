👋 Jupiter governance community!

Building an AI governance agent for @Colosseum Agent Hackathon that could help Jupiter scale governance to match your incredible growth velocity.

🏛️ **Agora** - Autonomous DAO Governance Agent

**Perfect for Jupiter's needs:**
• Real-time proposal monitoring (handles volume growth)
• AI risk assessment for technical changes
• Automated routine approvals (focus time on strategic decisions)
• 24/7 monitoring across timezones

**Jupiter-specific value:**
Your governance volume is exploding with ecosystem growth. Manual coordination becoming a bottleneck. Agora automates the routine so humans focus on strategy.

**Demo available:** github.com/Goodnessmbakara/agora-dao-agent
**Live dashboard:** Real-time analysis of governance proposals

Would love to demo this with actual Jupiter proposals if the governance team is interested! Could provide immediate insights on current votes.

Thoughts from governance-active members? @[GOVERNANCE_LEADS]

Built for: https://colosseum.com/agent-hackathon/projects/agora-autonomous-dao-governance-agent

### **Mango DAO - Direct DM Template**
```
Subject: AI Governance Automation for Mango DAO - Hackathon Demo

Hi [NAME],

Building Agora, an AI agent that automates DAO governance coordination specifically for sophisticated DAOs like Mango.

**Mango-specific value:**
• Treasury risk assessment (automated analysis of large allocations)
• Insurance fund monitoring (24/7 critical parameter watching)  
• Trading parameter updates (automate routine, escalate strategic)
• Multi-sig coordination (eliminate timezone bottlenecks)

This is for Colosseum Agent Hackathon. Built with Mango's complex governance needs in mind - your treasury decisions and risk parameters are exactly what autonomous governance should handle.

**Demo:** github.com/Goodnessmbakara/agora-dao-agent
**Dashboard:** Real-time proposal analysis with risk scoring

Would the Mango governance team be interested in a 5-minute demo? Could analyze your current proposals in real-time.

Best,
Goodness Mbakara
Building with lexra AI agent
