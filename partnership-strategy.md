Subject: AI Governance Automation for [DAO_NAME] - Hackathon Demo

Hi [GOVERNANCE_LEAD],

I'm building Agora, an AI agent that automates DAO governance coordination. 

Built specifically for Solana DAOs like [DAO_NAME], it:
• Monitors Realms proposals 24/7
• Analyzes risk/sentiment automatically  
• Handles routine votes, escalates strategic decisions
• 25% automation rate (conservative approach)

This is for the Colosseum Agent Hackathon. Would [DAO_NAME] be interested in a live demo? Could provide governance insights for your current proposals.

Demo: https://github.com/Goodnessmbakara/agora-dao-agent
5-min call available if useful.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME] (building with lexra AI agent)
```

### Template 2: Discord Governance Channel Post

```
👋 [DAO_NAME] governance community!

Building an AI governance agent for the @Colosseum Agent Hackathon that I think could help [DAO_NAME]:

🏛️ **Agora** - Autonomous DAO Governance Agent

**What it does:**
• Monitors all [DAO_NAME] proposals in real-time
• AI risk assessment (financial impact, security, community sentiment)  
• Automates routine votes, alerts for strategic decisions
• Comprehensive audit logging for transparency

**Why this matters for [DAO_NAME]:**
[SPECIFIC_DAO_PAIN_POINT - e.g., "With Jupiter's rapid growth, governance needs to scale to match velocity"]

**Built specifically for Solana governance:**
✅ Live Realms integration
✅ SPL Governance program monitoring
✅ Multi-DAO architecture

Would love to demo this with actual [DAO_NAME] proposals if the community is interested! Could provide immediate governance insights.

**Demo:** https://github.com/Goodnessmbakara/agora-dao-agent
**Hackathon:** https://colosseum.com/agent-hackathon/projects/agora-autonomous-dao-governance-agent

### Template 3: Twitter Thread Template

```
🧵 Thread: Why [DAO_NAME] needs AI governance automation

1/ [DAO_NAME] processes X proposals/month. Each requires:
   • Risk analysis
   • Community sentiment assessment  
   • Coordination across timezones
   • Manual vote execution

2/ Built Agora specifically for Solana DAOs to solve this:
   🏛️ 24/7 proposal monitoring
   🤖 AI risk assessment  
   ⚡ Automated routine decisions
   👥 Human oversight for strategic choices

3/ Demo with realistic [DAO_NAME] scenarios:
   • Treasury allocation → HIGH risk → Human review ✓
   • Parameter updates → LOW risk → Auto-approve ✓
   • Emergency patches → CRITICAL → Immediate escalation ✓

4/ This is what governance at machine speed looks like.

   DAOs should focus on strategy, not coordination bottlenecks.

   Built for @Colosseum Agent Hackathon

5/ [DAO_NAME] governance team - interested in a live demo? 

   @[GOVERNANCE_LEADS] 

   Could analyze your current proposals in real-time.
